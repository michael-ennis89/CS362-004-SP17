Bug: Smithy Card 
Expected Outcome: 
	-Current Player starts with 5 cards.
	-Current player draws 3 cards. 
	-Current player discards 1 card.
	-Current player ends turn with 7 cards. 
Cause:
	There appears to be two bugs, 1 directly in the code of the Smithy card and one
in the draw card function. 
	The bug inside the Smithy Card of Travis' code is on line 12 of dominion.c. This
is the function that should run three times to draw 3 cards from the deck; however
for (i = 0; i < 1; i++) will terminate after 1 loop thus only drawing 1 card and causing
the error 65.7% of the time. Chaning the 1 to a 3 fixes this bug. in the 65.7% of the
time that the bug occured because of this line of code.
	The second bug seems to deal with the draw card function that is occuring 34.3% of
time.

Symptoms:
	Random test generator on the smithy card ran 1000 tests of which all 1000 failed.
657/1000 (65.7%) Player has 5 cards in hand instead of 7 after card is played.
343/1000 (34.3%) Player has -1 cards in hand instead of 7 after card is played.

Priority & Severity:
	Both of these bugs are high priority because they efect the gameplay of the dominion
card game; however, the bug directly inside the code of the Smithy Card only effects
the game when the card is played. If the card isn't ever played it wont effect the game.
Although it is a high priority, the severity of it is lessened. 
	The second bug that appears to be coming inside the drawCard function is a much
higher priority bug because the function is called throughout the dominion game and
greatly effects the outcome of the game. Because of this it would be a very high priority
and severity if not fixed. 

Bug: Great Hall Card
Expected Outcome:
	-Current Player recieves +1 card
	-Current Player recieves +1 action
	-Current Player discards 1 card.
	-Current Player ends hand with 4 cards. 
	
Cause:
	There appears to be two bugs, 1 directly in the code of the Great Hall card and one
in the draw card function again.
	The bug instide the Great Hall card of Travis' code is on line 71 of dominion.c. This
line should have a increment of actions "++" but instead it has a decrement "--" of actions.
This it causes a difference of 2. All of the actions should start with 1 and end with two
;however on normal error cases not effected by drawCard it would start with 1 and end with 0.
	The second bug seems to deal with the draw card function that is occuring 30.7% of the
time. 

Symptoms: 
	Random test generator on the great hall card ran 1000 tests of which all 1000 failed;
however, the bug is a little more in depth that straight pass and fail.
Overall
1000/1000 (100%) Player has the incorrect number of actions
307/1000  (307%) Player has the incorrect number of cards

The important thing to note is that there are 693 tests where it is only the actions which
are bugged meaning the card count is correct in those 693 tests. However, in the 307 tests
where there is -1 cards instead of 0 there is also an error with the amount of actions at 
1 action neeeded vs -1 actions have instad of 2 actions needed vs 0 actions have.

Priority and Severity:
	Like the bug in the smithy card, both of these bugs are high priority; however, similar
again, it only occurs when the great hall card is played where as the drawCard function
again shows effects the program every time it is called. Thus the severity of the drawCard
function is much Higher.
